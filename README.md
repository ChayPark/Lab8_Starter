1. I would fit the automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed because the testing suite should be automated and make testing consistent among all collaborators that push to a repository. By automating the tests within a Github action, we ensure that the tests are consistently run whenever new code is pushed, regardless of the individual developer's workflow. This promotes a standardized and reliable testing process, making it easier to catch any issues or bugs early on. It also facilitates collaboration among team members by providing a consistent testing environment for everyone working on the Recipe project.
2. No, an end-to-end test is not typically used to check if a function is returning the correct output. End-to-end tests are primarily focused on simulating user interactions and verifying the overall behavior and flow of a system or application. They are more suitable for testing the entire user journey and ensuring that various components of the system work together correctly. To check if a function is returning the correct output, unit tests or integration tests would be more appropriate. 
3. I would not use a unit test for the messaging feature of a messaging application because unit tests are designed to test individual units of code in isolation. The messaging feature involves communication between multiple components and requires verification on both the sender and receiver ends to ensure that messages are correctly displayed on both devices. Unit tests alone cannot provide this end-to-end verification and are better suited for testing isolated functionality within the application. Integration tests or end-to-end tests are more appropriate for testing the messaging feature as they can simulate the actual communication between users and verify the correct display of messages on both devices.
4. Yes, you could use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application. The "max message length" feature is a specific and isolated functionality within the application that can be tested independently without relying on other components.
